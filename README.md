# RGBAudio
A program made in C# to control a led with audio. The RGB led will be brighter on audio peaks. This project is made in my first year of learning C#. The code won't look clean but I did my best.
# How to install
1. Make sure the RGB LED is correctly attached to the Arduino.
1. Download and upload [StandardFirmataPlus](https://github.com/firmata/arduino) to your arduino.
1. Download the exe file and open it.
1. Choose an audio device.
